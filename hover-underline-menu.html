    <h1>Dave Peck</h1>
    <b><p class="bio">David Peck is an aspiring sports broadcaster from Old Lyme, Connecticut. He currently studies
                    history and theater at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and is a former member of both the
                    varsity football and baseball teams. Dave is expected to graduate from Bowdoin in the spring of
                    2019, and is planning on attending graduate school in the field of sports media.
                    As an aspiring sports broadcaster, Dave structured his liberal arts education in a way that would
                    give him the tools to be successful in the business. Combining the critical reading and writing
                    skills of a history major with the ability to perform and entertain in an engaging way has helped
                    him prepare for the world of broadcasting.<br>
                    After competing in both football and baseball, Dave struggled to recover from multiple
                    concussions, forcing him to take a year off from Bowdoin. Upon his return, Dave became
                    heavily involved in covering the Bowdoin College Polar Bears as a way to stay involved in
                    sports and gain first-hand experience behind the microphone.<br>
                    Throughout his time in college, Dave has been a part of numerous sports media outlets. Although
                    Bowdoin's liberal arts education does not include formal broadcasting education, Dave has taken
                    advantage of the many sports media opportunities on campus. From conducting interviews and
                    broadcasting various sports for the Bowdoin College Athletic Department to broadcasting high
                    school games on the local radio, the experience gained at school helped him excel as a
                    broadcaster.<br>
                    After working as the Newport Gulls' field reporter and color commentator for the 2017 NECBL
                    season, Dave is excited to return to Newport as the lead play-by- play broadcaster in 2018.</p></b>
