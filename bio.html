      <p style="width: 70%; text-align: justify">Dave Peck is a sports broadcaster from Old Lyme, Connecticut and a rising senior at Bowdoin College where he studies history and theater as a way to use the liberal arts education to build the necessary skills for broadcasting.<br> 
      After competing on both the Bowdoin Varsity Football and Baseball teams, Dave has gained experience in various broadcasting positions for the Bowdoin College Polar Bears and high school sport teams throughout Maine. He has been a sports contributor for Radio 9 WCME since the summer of 2016 and has hosted a Bowdoin sports-talk radio show on 91.1 WBOR. On campus, Dave spearheaded Bowdoin Polar Bear Nation, an Instagram account that gives voice to athletes and coaches through weekly interviews. He also served as the play-by-play broadcaster for Bowdoin Baseball, calling all 33 games on both the Northeast Sports Network and the Bowdoin Baseball Network. Dave worked for the Newport Gulls as Field Reporter and Color Commentator during the 2017 NECBL season and was promoted to Lead Broadcaster in the summer of 2018 where he called all 44 games for the Gulls.
      <br>After Bowdoin, Dave plans on attending a graduate school program in the field of journalism with the ultimate goal of becoming an established sportscaster on either television or radio.</p>
