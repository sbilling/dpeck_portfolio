          Dave Peck is a sports broadcaster from Old Lyme, CT, and currently
          works as a Sports Production Intern at NBC 10 Boston in Newton, MA.

          degree in journalism with a specialization in sports media.<br />
          Graduating from Bowdoin College in 2019, Dave studied history and
          theater as a way to use the liberal arts education to build the
          necessary skills for broadcasting. After competing on both the Bowdoin
          Varsity Football and Baseball teams, Dave gained experience in various
          broadcasting positions for the Bowdoin College Polar Bears and high
          school sport teams throughout Maine. He contributed as a broadcaster
          for Radio Midcoast WCME from 2016 to 2019 and served as the Sports
          Manager of Bowdoin’s 91.1 WBOR station where he brought Bowdoin
          Athletics to the airwaves. <br />As a Polar Bear, Dave spearheaded
          Bowdoin Polar Bear Nation, an Instagram account that gave voice to
          athletes and coaches through weekly interviews and feature segments.
          He also served as the play-by-play broadcaster for Bowdoin Baseball,
          calling all 33 games on both the Northeast Sports Network and the
          Bowdoin Baseball Network.<br />Dave worked for the Newport Gulls as
          Field Reporter and Color Commentator during the 2017 NECBL season and
          was promoted to Lead Broadcaster in the summer of 2018 where he called
          all 44 games for the Gulls.<br />During his 2018 semester in Rome,
          Dave worked with the S.S. Lazio Ducks American Football team as both a
          reporter intern and quarterback coach.
