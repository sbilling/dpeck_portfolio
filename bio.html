          Dave Peck is a sports broadcaster from Old Lyme, Connecticut and a
          senior at Bowdoin College where he studies history and theater as a
          way to use the liberal arts education to build the necessary skills
          for broadcasting.<br />
          After competing on both the Bowdoin Varsity Football and Baseball
          teams, Dave has gained experience in various broadcasting positions
          for the Bowdoin College Polar Bears and high school sport teams
          throughout Maine. He has been a sports contributor for Radio 9 WCME
          since the summer of 2016 and has hosted a Bowdoin sports-talk radio
          show on 91.1 WBOR. On campus, Dave spearheaded Bowdoin Polar Bear
          Nation, an Instagram account that gives voice to athletes and coaches
          through weekly interviews. He also served as the play-by-play
          broadcaster for Bowdoin Baseball, calling all 33 games on both the
          Northeast Sports Network and the Bowdoin Baseball Network. Dave worked
          for the Newport Gulls as Field Reporter and Color Commentator during
          the 2017 NECBL season and was promoted to Lead Broadcaster in the
          summer of 2018 where he called all 44 games for the Gulls. During his
          2018 semester abroad, Dave worked with the S.S. Lazio Ducks American
          Football team as both a reporter intern and quarterback coach.
          <br />Following graduation from Bowdoin, Dave plans on attending a
          graduate school program in the field of journalism with the goal of
          becoming an established sportscaster on either television or radio.
